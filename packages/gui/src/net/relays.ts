// Where two players' programs find each other. No server of this project's: public services pass the few
// messages that set a connection up (signaling), and public STUN servers tell each program its address as seen from the
// internet. After that the two programs talk directly (WebRTC); a TURN relay (the player's own, in the settings) carries
// the connection only when a direct one can't be made.
//
// The lists were checked from a test machine on 2026-09-29: the connection library's own
// relays that answered, plus a relay in Japan and STUN servers in China, since players may be in different countries.

/**
 * Tells this program's rooms apart from other programs' on the same public relays. 2: programs say which seat they want when
 * they join a room (spectators, online-3). It stays as it is from now on (2026-10-02): programs of every version meet in the
 * same rooms and are told when they differ (the "hello" message) rather than never finding each other; a new protocol
 * changes online.ts PROTOCOL and keeps the room's own messages (join, select, full, hello) as they are.

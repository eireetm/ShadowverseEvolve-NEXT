// Meeting in a room: the programs join room <code> on three public networks at once — Nostr, MQTT and
// BitTorrent trackers — through the Trystero library, which passes the WebRTC setup messages through the networks' relays,
// encrypted with the room code. A program joining says which seat it wants ("join": the other player's, or a spectator's)
// to each program it meets there; only the host answers: it takes it in ("select") or has no such seat left ("full"). The
// first one the host takes in fixes the network: the host leaves the others (a spectator who comes before the other player
// waits for that). The host stays in the room while it is connected, so spectators can come later and the other player
// can come back after a lost connection. A network whose relays can't be reached from one side simply never connects.

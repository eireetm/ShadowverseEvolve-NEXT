// BP17-T06 Curse of the Black Dragon — Dragoncraft spell token, 0. 竜族・武闘竜人・キラー.
// This can't be played unless Overflow is active for you.
// At the start of your end phase, if this is in your EX area and Overflow isn't active for you, deal 1 damage to your leader.
// (Valid in the EX area — ruling.)
// ----------
// Select a Rowen, Dragon Lance on your field and give it "If this would deal damage, it deals that much plus 1 instead" for
// the rest of this turn. (Two of them are +2; its attack damage and its abilities' damage — rulings.)

// BP15-046 Secrets of Onmyodo — Runecraft spell, 0. 挑戦者・陰陽師.
// As an additional cost to play this, reveal 2 Onmyoji cards from your hand.
// ----------
// {[costX]}: Search your deck for an Onmyoji follower that costs X or less, summon it, then shuffle. If there are
// at least 7 spells and/or Onmyoji cards in your cemetery, put a Paper Shikigami token into your EX area and give
// it "This costs 1 less to play." X equals a number of your choice.
// (元のコスト. X may be 0; the token comes even if no follower is found; a card that is both counts once —
// rulings. The play points are an optional process as the spell resolves, CR 10.4.7.2, 10.4.7.5; nothing
// happens between playing and resolving it, so choosing X then is the same as choosing it when playing.)

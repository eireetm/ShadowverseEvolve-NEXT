// CP04-045 Kyoka — Runecraft follower, 2, 2/2. プリコネ・リトルリリカル.
// {[evolve]} {[cost01]}: Evolve this.
// {[fanfare]} Select a PriConne spell in your cemetery. Put it into your EX area and give it "At the start of your end phase, if this
// is in your EX area, bury it." (The card's own ability: it stays if Kyoka leaves the field — ruling. It is had until the card
// leaves the EX area, so it acts once, at its controller's next end phase: a delayed trigger watching that card, CR 10.7.5.)

/**
 * Information-set sampling for bots: deal the cards `viewer` can't identify (CR 4.1.2)
 * again at random, so that a copy of the game tells nothing the viewer doesn't know.
 *
 * Pools of cards that could be swapped with each other, as the viewer sees them:
 *  - an opponent's hand and deck together (a card in the hand could be any card not seen yet);
 *  - an opponent's facedown evolve deck cards (4.6.2), and their facedown banished cards (4.10.2);
 *  - the viewer's own deck, whose order nobody knows (4.5.2).
 * The multiset of each pool stays the real one: the opponent's deck list counts as known. Cards the
 * viewer has been shown (`keep`, the revealed cards, and the hidden cards they remember: CardInstance.knownBy,
 * engine/state/knowledge.ts) keep their identity; what the other player remembered of a card dealt again is dropped (it was
 * about the real card, and which of them they remember could tell the viewer something). Only `def` and `printing`
 * move; everything else (effects on the card, counters) stays with the slot, which is what the
 * viewer knows ("the second card in their hand costs 1 less").
